# Pokémon Card Game

## Project Overview
This is a card-matching game built using the Pokémon API, created during a hackathon organized by BrainStation. The game allows users to flip cards and match Pokémon images. If the cards match, the images are revealed, and the player continues until all pairs are matched.

## Key Features
- **Card Matching Game**: Flip cards and match Pokémon pairs.
- **Pokémon API Integration**: Fetches real-time Pokémon data for the game.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on both desktop and mobile devices using a responsive grid layout.
- **Dynamic Content**: Utilizes JavaScript to dynamically generate and display game elements.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML5**: Structure of the game layout.
- **CSS3**: Styling and animations for a smooth and engaging user experience.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for the game, including card flipping, matching, and API calls.
- **Pokémon API**: Integrated to fetch Pokémon images and data.
- **Version Control**: Managed via Git and hosted on GitHub.

## How to Play
1. The player clicks on a card to flip it.
2. A second card is flipped to find a match.
3. If the two flipped cards match, the Pokémon images are revealed.
4. The game continues until all pairs are matched.

## Installation and Setup
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Mannsingh22/poke.git

### Steps to add this Markdown README to GitHub:

1. Create a `README.md` file in your repository root directory if it’s not there already.
2. Copy and paste the Markdown content from above directly into the `README.md` file.
3. Commit and push the changes to your repository.
4. GitHub automatically renders the Markdown file and applies the correct formatting.

Now, your README should look exactly like the well-formatted version on GitHub. Let me know if you need more help!
